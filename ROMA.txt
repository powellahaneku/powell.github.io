ROMA
[Chorus]
my homeboys more of the singing type
too many girls invited 
man thats more like an open mic 

she dont chat bout me to her friends 
cus she knows they the walkey talky type
annoying type adoring type

breakfast in bed in the morning type
5am and theyd prolly slide

with the guys since that card declined
now they swipe for shoes that they havent treid it

lowkey so I like when she puts her accounts on private
Burning calories no diet
Airplane mode and her phones on silent 
Took her to a different tribe 
cuz she said bad guy you could be my pilot

[verse]

when your ten toes down theres no need to tiptoe baby
what you got in them hips tho baby
Like how you dance to calypso baby
why your man in a rental baby?
Come over ill send you the lyft tho baby?
why your man in a rental baby?
why your man in a rental baby?



now its apple pay like its apple paid




theyd show me love ive been lately ive been cold inside
with the guys since that card declined
now we swiping visas, but dont trust what you see online

been making moves ive got motion sickness
